## Summary
The main utility of this app is to see a forecast across multiple cities and date ranges in a single view, instead of needing to check multiple extended forecasts for each city one by one.

A simple form is displayed to a add a location with an arrival and departure date to an itinerary.

Multiple road trip stops with varying stay durations can be added to the itinerary, with the ability to delete indivudual stops, or clear the entire itinerary.

After the forecasts are displayed, users can click back to the itinerary to make further edits.
